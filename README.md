# Important notes
- The objects are not to scale or placed properly with the Unity scene. Many objects were rescaled and moved in the final Unity scene. Refer to the Unity scene for proper placement.
- None of the objects have materials assigned, so edits to materials or map assignments will be done in Unity.
- Objects are modelled at a **low LOD** to reduce memory overhead, drawcalls, and filesize.
- Override with Fast Shader is enabled by default in the Max file. Switch to OFF to disable culling of backfaces.
- The object's scale is in **meters**.
